4,Are algorithms really biased against people of colour,"Safiya U. Noble's work, particularly her book ""Algorithms of Oppression,"" sheds light on how algorithms exhibit bias against people of color. She emphasizes that this bias is embedded within seemingly neutral search engines, highlighting the generation and perpetuation of racism, especially anti-blackness, through the internet.
