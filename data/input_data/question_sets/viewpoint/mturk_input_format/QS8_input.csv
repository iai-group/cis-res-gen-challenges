Safiya U. Noble\'s research, exemplified in her book ""Algorithms of Oppression,"" argues that bias against people of color is embedded in seemingly neutral search engines, particularly Google, leading to the perpetuation of racism and anti-blackness on the internet. In contrast, Google contends that its search algorithm reflects online content availability and doesn\'t represent the company\'s own opinions, emphasizing a commitment to diverse perspectives.', ""The Watergate scandal had a profoundly negative impact on President Nixon's legacy, overshadowing many of his domestic achievements. It tarnished his reputation as a corrupt politician, making him a symbol of political scandal and misconduct in both American politics and popular culture. While he did enact significant legislation like creating the Environmental Protection Agency, his presidency is primarily remembered for the scandal, leading to his resignation and becoming synonymous with political corruption and disgrace. "", 'The U.S. reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement addressing police brutality and racial injustive included efforts to counteract perceived anti-police rhetoric. It was demonstrated by Louisiana\'s addition of police officers and firefighters to their state hate crime statute, inspired in part by the ""Blue Lives Matter"" slogan. This response arose amid debates over the movement\'s rhetoric and the claim that police officers were being targeted. ', ""Users of social networks receive recommendations and benefits in return for sharing their personal information. Social networking platforms gather vast amounts of user data and use it to provide tailored recommendations for individuals, businesses, and enterprises. For example, Facebook's recommendation system allows users to indicate their preferences, and this data is shared with partner websites, influencing the content users see on those sites."", ""Philosopher Barry Dainton has offered a modification to Bostrom's trilemma by introducing the concept of 'neural ancestor simulations,' suggesting that experiences within such simulations could be indistinguishable from non-simulated experiences. This modification leads to the conclusion that either few posthuman civilizations run these simulations, or we are ourselves within such a simulation."", ""Even though, not all aspects of social media are detrimental, these platforms can indeed play a role in your son's low self-esteem. It exposes teenagers to idealized standards of perfection, making them feel pressured to conform and leading to uncertainty about their identity and self-worth. This constant exposure can also contribute to depression, and social media can negatively impact a teen's self-esteem by influencing their style, friendships, and even leading to addiction and related health issues."", ""Climate change profoundly affects the health of people in developing countries, particularly the world's poorest nations. The Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports estimate that climate change causes around 400,000 deaths annually in these regions, with a significant impact on health primarily due to hunger and communicable diseases. Developing countries, with their limited resources and infrastructure, are especially vulnerable to these health-related consequences of climate change, highlighting the pressing need for global climate justice."", ""One approach for fixing social security, as suggested by Peter A. Diamond and Peter R. Orszag, involves stabilizing Social Security by implementing tax and spending adjustments, ending the borrowing from payroll taxes, and increasing dedicated revenues. Another viewpoint, represented by Robert Reich, argues for lifting the income ceiling on Social Security taxes to ensure its long-term sustainability. Additionally, there are proposals, such as those put forth by Johnson, advocating for raising the retirement age, implementing means testing, and potentially exploring privatization as ways to address Social Security's challenges."", ""Marvel Studios' approach to diversity for people of color has evolved, particularly in Phase Four, where the emphasis is on introducing new characters and ensuring more diverse casts. This change reflects a response to past criticism regarding the underrepresentation of minorities in Marvel films, including casting decisions in the Avengers like Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin and Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One. The studio is committed to creating a more inclusive group of characters and avoiding a predominantly white, European cast in its future movies."", 'The pros of GMO food labeling, as advocated by organizations like the American Public Health Association and the European Commission, include providing consumers with the information necessary for informed choices, preventing potential consumer confusion, and facilitating the recall of products in the event of adverse health or environmental effects. This labeling can enhance transparency in the food supply chain and empower consumers to make decisions aligned with their preferences and concerns regarding genetically modified organisms.']","['A1', 'A2', 'A2', 'A3', 'A3', 'A2', 'A3', 'A1', 'A1', 'A3']","[['Algorithms, like those used in search engines such as Google, can inadvertently perpetuate societal biases, particularly against people of color.', 'Algorithmic bias is a widespread concern, not limited to search engines, and can manifest in various technological applications, including hiring processes and criminal justice systems.', '""Algorithms of Oppression"" is a book by Safiya U.
