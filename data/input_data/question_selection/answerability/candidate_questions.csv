Give one of these a try.  By Amy Marturana Winderl, C.P.T. Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Giustina / Getty Images Running is a great form of exercise.  It comes with benefits both mental and physical.  I'm personally a huge fan.  If you're trying to burn lots of calories with your workouts, running is a pretty good option.  But if you're looking to maximize your calorie burn or switch up your high-intensity workouts, there are plenty of other options to consider.  Before we go any further, it's important to note that there are so many great reasons to work out that have nothing to do with burning calories or weight loss, and we're not suggesting that your goal should be either of those things.  If it is your goal, that's totally fine, but it's important not to overdo it or exercise compulsively.  And if you've struggled with disordered eating or compulsive exercising, always speak with your doctor before starting any new fitness routine.

The engine is slated to be used on a future super-heavy rocket, the Starship.  Although it has a lower specific impulse than liquid hydrogen, liquid methane can be produced on Mars via the Sabatier reaction and is easier to store than liquid hydrogen due to its higher boiling point and density, as well as its lack of hydrogen embrittlement.  It also leaves less residue in the engines compared to kerosene, which is beneficial for reusability.

Privacy concerns with social networking services is a subset of data privacy, involving the right of mandating personal privacy concerning storing, re-purposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Social network security and privacy issues result from the astronomical amounts of information these sites process each day. Features that invite users to participate in—messages, invitations, photos, open platform applications and other applications are often the venues for others to gain access to a user's private information. In addition, the technologies needed to deal with user’s information may intrude their privacy. More specifically, In the case of Facebook. Adrienne Felt, a Ph.D. candidate at Berkeley, made small headlines last year when she exposed a potentially devastating hole in the framework of Facebook's third-party application programming interface (API). It made it easier for people to lose their privacy. Felt and her co-researchers found that third-party platform applications on Facebook are provided with far more user information than it is needed. This potential privacy breach is actually built into the systematic framework of Facebook. Unfortunately, the flaws render the system to be almost indefensible. 'The question for social networks is resolving the difference between mistakes in implementation and what the design of the application platform is intended to allow,' said David Evans, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. Moreover, there is also the question of who should be held responsible for the lack of user privacy? According to Evan, the answer to the question is not likely to be found, because a better regulated API would be required for Facebook 'to break a lot of applications, [especially when] a lot of companies are trying to make money off [these] applications.'
