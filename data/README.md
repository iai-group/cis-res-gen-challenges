# Data

A critical element of both user studies is selecting query-response pairs that enable us to answer our research queries and best represent the particular challenges. We use twenty search queries from TREC CAsT '20 and '22 and we manually craft responses with the different experimental conditions mirroring everyday system interactions. 

## Queries

Details about the process of selecting queries for each use study are covered [here](queries/README.md).

## Responses

Details about the process of generating response for each use study are covered [here](responses/README.md).

## Input Data
