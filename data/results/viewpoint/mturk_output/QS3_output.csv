""Blue Lives Matter"" emerged as a pro-police response to concerns raised by the Black Lives Matter movement about police brutality. This response was driven by concerns about perceived anti-police rhetoric from the Black Lives Matter movement.', 'The pros of GMO food labeling include supporting informed choice for consumers, avoiding potential consumer misinformation, and facilitating product withdrawals if adverse health or environmental effects are discovered.

Another viewpoint, represented by Robert Reich, argues for lifting the income ceiling on Social Security taxes to ensure its long-term sustainability.
