6,1,What do other philosophers think about Bostrom's 'simulation argument'?,"Philosopher Barry Dainton has offered a modification to Bostrom's trilemma by introducing the concept of 'neural ancestor simulations,' suggesting that experiences within such simulations could be indistinguishable from non-simulated experiences. This modification leads to the conclusion that either few posthuman civilizations run these simulations, or we are ourselves within such a simulation. However, some scholars reject this reasoning as philosophical and unfalsifiable, while others suggest that we might be in the first generation of simulations where simulated entities do not yet exist.",A2,"[""Philosopher Barry Dainton proposed a modification to Bostrom's trilemma, suggesting that we might be in a simulation where experiences are indistinguishable from non-simulated ones."", 'Advancements in technology, like virtual reality, continue to blur the lines between real and simulated experiences.', 'The concept of simulated reality has been a topic of interest in popular culture, with movies like ""The Matrix"" exploring similar themes.

0,2,What was the US reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement?,"The U.S. reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement included some states, like Louisiana, responding by adding police officers and firefighters to their state hate crime statute, often aligning with the ""Blue Lives Matter"" movement. ""Blue Lives Matter"" emerged as a pro-police response to concerns raised by the Black Lives Matter movement about police brutality. This response was driven by concerns about perceived anti-police rhetoric from the Black Lives Matter movement.",A3,"['Debates around freedom of speech and protests have emerged, highlighting the complexities of addressing these issues in a diverse society.', 'The phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" was popularized on social media through the use of the hashtag BlackLivesMatter.', 'The U.S. reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement involved legislative actions, along with the emergence of counter-movements like ""Blue Lives Matter.""']","[0, 0, 1]","['3', '3', '3']","['3', '4', '2']","['4', '3', '3']","['3', '2', '2']","['4', '2', '2']","['4', '2', '2']","['The answer provided a counter point / movement towards the original movement of Black life matters thus providing a contrast of difference of idealogy.', 'It mostly takes the focus off the central topic (BLM)', 'The answer does not articulate more viewpoints.']","['option_3', 'option_2', 'option_1']","['option_1', 'option_1', 'option_1']","['option_1', 'option_2', 'option_3']"
2,3,Can social security be fixed?,"One approach for fixing social security, as suggested by Peter A. Diamond and Peter R. Orszag, involves stabilizing Social Security by implementing tax and spending adjustments, ending the borrowing from payroll taxes, and increasing dedicated revenues. Another viewpoint, represented by Robert Reich, argues for lifting the income ceiling on Social Security taxes to ensure its long-term sustainability. Additionally, there are proposals, such as those put forth by Johnson, advocating for raising the retirement age, implementing means testing, and potentially exploring privatization as ways to address Social Security's challenges.",A1,"[""Means testing is a concept where Social Security benefits are adjusted based on an individual's financial means."", ""The income ceiling, also known as the Social Security wage base, is the maximum amount of an individual's income that is subject to Social Security taxes."", 'Various proposals have been suggested to address the challenges facing Social Security, including tax and spending adjustments, lifting income ceilings on taxes, and potential privatization.']","[0, 0, 1]","['3', '3', '3']","['3', '3', '2']","['3', '4', '3']","['3', '4', '3']","['4', '4', '3']","['3', '4', '3']","['The answer to the question only provided possibilities without commitment to an absolute resolution to the problem, The question remains unanswered.', 'It gives specific ideas that have been proposed to solve the problem.', 'The answer is objective, no rhetoric, and offers several points.']","['option_3', 'option_2', 'option_1']","['option_1', 'option_1', 'option_1']","['option_1', 'option_2', 'option_3']"
7,4,Are algorithms really biased against people of colour,"Safiya U. Noble's work, particularly her book ""Algorithms of Oppression,"" sheds light on how algorithms exhibit bias against people of color. She emphasizes that this bias is embedded within seemingly neutral search engines, highlighting the generation and perpetuation of racism, especially anti-blackness, through the internet. Even though companies like Google contend that its search algorithm only reflects online content availability, Noble points out Google's monopoly and the opacity of its algorithm, which produces results whose inner workings are not transparent to users.",A2,"['Safiya U.

9,5,What effects did the Watergate scandal have on President Nixon's legacy?,"The Watergate scandal had a profoundly negative impact on President Nixon's legacy. It tarnished his reputation as a corrupt politician, making him a symbol of political scandal and misconduct in both American politics and popular culture.

4,6,Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?,"Studies show that a significant percentage of teenagers feel pressured to present only the best aspects of their lives on social media, leading to feelings of inadequacy and a negative impact on their self-esteem.
