Danish research shows that new runners seeking weight loss who ran more than 5km (3.1 miles) per week for one year and adjusted their diets lost an average of 12.3 pounds, while those who didn't change their diets lost 8.4 pounds. For faster weight loss, consider gradually increasing your running duration and frequency (with a long-term goal of building up to 60 minutes of running per day, six days per week), but remember that a well-balanced diet remains crucial to achieving your goals."", 'You can obtain impartial search results from search engines like DuckDuckGo by using platforms that do not store your personal information or track your online activities.
