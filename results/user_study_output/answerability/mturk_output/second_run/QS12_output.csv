Airbus announced the discontinuation in February 2019 after its main customer, Emirates, reduced its A380 order and shifted to smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft like the A330-900 and A350-900. With production costs exceeding the selling price and airlines favoring point-to-point routes over hub-and-spoke systems, the A380 program became economically unsustainable for Airbus, leading to the decision to stop production.', 'To obtain impartial search engine results, ensure you clear your browser cookies and history regularly, use a variety of search engines, and search in incognito mode to avoid personalization.
