1,1,What’s the best bike seat,"The ""best"" bike seat can vary greatly depending on individual preferences, body shape, and riding style. Seats from reputable brands like Spinergy, NexusRides, CycleCraft, TrekTech, and GTB are often well-regarded for their comfort and quality. It's important to consider factors such as saddle width, padding, shape, and intended use (road, mountain, touring) when choosing a bike seat. Visiting a local bike shop and trying out different seats is often the best way to find one that suits your comfort needs.",A3,"['Proper bike seat selection is crucial for avoiding discomfort and pain during extended rides..', 'Bike shops with knowledgeable staff can provide valuable guidance and allow cyclists to test various seats .', 'The choice of the ""best"" bike seat depends on individual preferences, body shape, and riding style.']","[0, 0, 1]","['3', '3', '3']","['1', '1', '1']","['4', '4', '4']","['4', '4', '4']","['4', '4', '4']","[""In my opinion, knowing that a bicycle seat depends on who you are, how you're built, the bicycle and how you're going to ride the bicycle is common knowledge.

8,6,Interesting. What was the basis of the backlash Marvel Studios faced for the Vice President’s suggestion that diversity was causing sales to slide?,"The backlash against Marvel Studios was rooted in the revelation of an unpublished decision by the studio chairs to reduce diversity and prioritize the hiring of predominantly white males for future productions.
