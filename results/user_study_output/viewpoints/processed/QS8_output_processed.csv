4,1,What do other philosophers think about Bostrom's 'simulation argument'?,"Philosopher Barry Dainton has offered a modification to Bostrom's trilemma by introducing the concept of 'neural ancestor simulations,' suggesting that experiences within such simulations could be indistinguishable from non-simulated experiences.

7,3,Can social security be fixed?,"One approach for fixing social security, as suggested by Peter A. Diamond and Peter R. Orszag, involves stabilizing Social Security by implementing tax and spending adjustments, ending the borrowing from payroll taxes, and increasing dedicated revenues. Another viewpoint, represented by Robert Reich, argues for lifting the income ceiling on Social Security taxes to ensure its long-term sustainability.

0,4,Are algorithms really biased against people of colour,"David Oppenheimer, a law professor at University of California at Berkeley highlights that algorithms, even when not intentionally designed to discriminate, can reproduce societal biases. Safiya U. Noble's research, exemplified in her book ""Algorithms of Oppression,"" argues that bias against people of color is embedded in seemingly neutral search engines, particularly Google, leading to the perpetuation of racism and anti-blackness on the internet. In contrast, Google contends that its search algorithm reflects online content availability and doesn't represent the company's own opinions, emphasizing a commitment to diverse perspectives.",A1,"['Algorithms, like those used in search engines such as Google, can inadvertently perpetuate societal biases, particularly against people of color.', 'Algorithmic bias is a widespread concern, not limited to search engines, and can manifest in various technological applications, including hiring processes and criminal justice systems.', '""Algorithms of Oppression"" is a book by Safiya U.

8,8,What is Marvel Studios’ approach to diversity for people of color?,"Marvel Studios' approach to diversity for people of color has evolved, particularly in Phase Four, where the emphasis is on introducing new characters and ensuring more diverse casts.
